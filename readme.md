# Pemmy's Paint

Pemmy's Paint is a 2D game built with the Godot Engine. The game features no ending (like a typical Pemmy game) and no way to move the character around. Enjoy a truly unique gameplay experience. Amazing, right? Lol.

### Installation

You can find the game on Itch.io and play it in a browser. Truly groundbreaking.

### About

Pemmy's Paint was made in just 24 hours as a fun project for a small streamer, intended as a lighthearted joke. And wow, what a masterpiece it turned out to be!
